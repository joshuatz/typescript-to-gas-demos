# Typescript to Google Apps - Using ts2gas directly

## Build
`npm run build`

## Special Dependencies
 - You need to install TS type definition files:
     - `npm install` based on package.json
     - Not necessary for build to work, but IDE will complain without it
 - ts2gas (in package.json)
 - fs-extra (in package.json)
